## üöÄ Deployment

Tumbleweed provides a custom Command Line Interface (CLI) tool and uses Terraform to provision and deploy Tumbleweed pipelines on AWS ECS (Elastic Cloud Services) using Fargate.

Prerequisites:

* An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
* IP address(es) that will have access to the Tumbleweed UI
* Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

You are now ready to deploy Tumbleweed!

Run the following command in your command line to get started:

```
npx tumbleweed_cdc roll
```

The pipeline can be destroyed with the following command:

```
npx tumbleweed_cdc burn
```
