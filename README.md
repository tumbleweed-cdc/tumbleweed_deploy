## üåµ What is Tumbleweed?

Tumbleweed is an open-source, user-friendly framework designed for fast and consistent data propagation between microservices using Change Data Capture (CDC) and the transactional outbox pattern.
It automatically deploys a self-hosted log-based CDC pipeline that abstracts away the complexities associated with setting up and using CDC tools. It is designed to monitor changes in one or more PostgreSQL databases and sync that data to consumer microservices in near real-time.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Getting Started

### üìù Configuring PostgreSQL

To enable Tumbleweed's Change Data Capture capabilities, your source PostgreSQL database must be version 10 or later and configured to use the **logical** replication mode by setting the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) level to `logical`.

Note: The location of the `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` files may vary depending on how PostgreSQL is installed. Additionally, these files are typically not directly accessible on managed cloud services, in which case you need to use the provider's configuration tools to modify these settings. (e.g, Parameter Groups on AWS RDS).
1. Modify the PostgreSQL Configuration File:
    * Locate the `postgresql.conf` file and update the following settings:
    ```
    wal_level = logical
    max_replication_slots = 5
    max_wal_senders = 5
    ```
   
    * `wal_level` must be set to `logical` to enable logical replication.
    * `max_replication_slots` number of maximum allowed replication slots.
    * `max_wal_senders` number of concurrent connections allowed for sending WAL data.
2. Edit the pg_hba.conf file:
    ```
    host replication all 0.0.0.0/0 md5
    ```
    * Update this file  by replacing `0.0.0.0/0` with a specific IP address or range to allow trusted connections for replication.
3. Apply the changes by restarting the PostgreSQL server using the command 
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart postgresql
  ```
4. Confirm the PostgreSQL server is correctly set up for logical replication by running the SQL query `SHOW wal_level`. The output should be `logical`.

### üîí Database Permissions

Tumbleweed requires the ability to create an "outbox" table in your source database to propagate changes to consumers. Ensure the provided database user has the necessary privileges to connect to the database, create tables, and insert data into them.

### üîÑ Updating Queries

Tumblweed also requires you to modify your existing database queries that involve create and update operations.  This involves inserting a corresponding record into the "outbox" table and then deleting it within the same transaction. 

1. Identify all SQL queries in your application that insert or update data in your source database.

2. Modify the queries to use transactions. This will vary based on the language being used. The corresponding record should include the following:
      * aggregatetype (event descriptor/topic name)
      * aggregateid (payload id)
      * type (event category sub-type)
      * payload (event data as JSONB object)

Here's an example of adding a transaction to a JavaScript application query that inserts data into an orders table:
```js
try {
  // Transaction Begin
  await query('BEGIN');

  // Original query
  const newOrder = await query(`INSERT INTO orders (product_name, cost)
                                VALUES ($1, $2)
                                RETURNING *`, 
                                [product_name, cost]);

  // Add the event to the outbox
  await query(`INSERT INTO outbox (aggregatetype, aggregateid, type, payload)
        VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)`,
        ['order', newOrder.rows[0].id, 'order_created', JSON.stringify(newOrder.rows[0])]);
   
  // Clear the outbox table after the record has been successfully processed
  await query(`DELETE from outbox`);

  // Transaction End
  await query('COMMIT'); 
} catch (error) {
  // Reverts transaction changes in case of errors
  await query('ROLLBACK');
}
```
**Abstract API for Outbox Events**

To facilitate sending events to the outbox table, a more abstract approach may be beneficial, especially in larger applications. This provides more flexbility by allowing easier modification of the implementation details of the outbox, as well as promoting code reusability.

Here is an example of a JavaScript interface implementation using a class:
```js
class OutboxService {
    constructor(query) {
        this.query = query; // Database query function
    }

    async addEvent(aggregateType, aggregateId, eventType, payload) {
        await this.query(`INSERT INTO outbox (aggregatetype, aggregateid, type, payload)
                          VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)`,
                          [aggregateType, aggregateId, eventType, JSON.stringify(payload)]);
    }

    async clearOutbox() {
        await this.query(`DELETE FROM outbox`);
    }
}
```
And here is an example of how it could be applied to the same transaction demonstrated in the previous section:
```js
// Pass the query function to the service
const outboxService = new OutboxService(query);

try {
  // Transaction Begin
  await query('BEGIN'); 

  // Original query
  const newOrder = await query(`INSERT INTO orders (product_name, cost)
                                VALUES ($1, $2)
                                RETURNING *`, 
                                [product_name, cost]);

  // Add the event to the outbox
  await outboxService.addEvent('order', newOrder.rows[0].id, 'order_created', newOrder.rows[0]);

  // Clear the outbox table after the record has been successfully processed
  await outboxService.clearOutbox();

  // Transaction End
  await query('COMMIT');
} catch (error) {
  // Reverts transaction changes in case of errors
  await query('ROLLBACK');
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Deployment

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool is provided to automatically deploy self-hosted Tumbleweed pipelines to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

**Prerequisites:**

* An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
* IP address(es) that will have access to the Tumbleweed UI
* Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

You are now ready to deploy Tumbleweed!

Run the following command in your command line to get started:

```
npx tumbleweed_cdc roll
```

The pipeline can be destroyed with the following command:

```
npx tumbleweed_cdc burn
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Destroying the pipeline will permanently delete all associated resources and data.

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Deployment

Manual deployment is also an option, whether locally or to an existing server of your choice using Docker.

**Prerequisites:**

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

<br>

1. Clone the tumbleweed repository to your server by running the following command in your command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/tumbleweed-cdc/tumbleweed
```

2. Navigate to the `tumbleweed/docker` directory.

3. Run the following command to spin up the necessary docker containers and start the application:

```
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```

4. The Tumbleweed UI can now be accessed at `localhost:3001`.

Use the following command to stop the Tumbleweed application and all of its docker containers:
```
sudo docker compose down -v
```

## üìä Consuming Data

Once a consumer is created in the Tumbleweed UI, it can be clicked on to view the consumer's details, including a provided Tumbleweed endpoint URL. This URL serves as a connection point for the consumer service to receive a stream of data from the topics they are subscribed to. The necessary code to establish a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection must be implemented in each consumer service. The implementation details may vary depending on the programming language or technology used by the microservice.

Here is an example of the necessary code implemented in JavaScript:
```js
import EventSource from 'eventsource';

// Replace URL with provided Tumbleweed endpoint URL
const eventSource = new EventSource("http://127.0.0.1:4001/tumbleweed/consumer1");

// Do something when new message is received
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received message:', message);
};

// Error handling
eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('EventSource failed:', error);
};
```
